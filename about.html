			<p>You're probably wondering who the guy behind the HTML curtain is.</p>
			
			<p>Well, my name is Jake Wells. I am a business information systems graduate looking to kickstart a career in business analysis.</p>
			<p>I've lived in Colorado Springs since I was only a year old. My dad was active duty Air Force at the time and we were stationed here and lived on the Air Force Academy. After two years, we moved into a house on the threshold of America's mountain, Pike's Peak, that became my home for over 20 years. Being able to grow up in such a beautiful city has been a privilege and it's a place I intend on continuing to call home for years to come.</p>
			<p>From an early age, I've had a knack for problem-solving and analysis. I often engaged this with puzzles as a child and as I got older tended to gravitate towards math problems, scientific concepts, and critical thinking exercises. Additionally, I've also had an eye for detail and a strong sense of creativity. Writing and creating stories, drawing, building LEGO, and playing music were all ways in which I expressed this creativity. In large part, these are all what lead me to pursue a degree in business with an emphasis in information systems.</p>
			<p>Being able to utilize my problem-solving skills and naturally analytical mindset in a career that would benefit others was exciting to me. Plus, it would allow me to follow in the footsteps of my mom and dad who are a computer engineer and information systems major respectively.</p>
			<p>Throughout my core classes, my analytical itch was scratched as I got to learn and understand the different departments of a business and work through issues that can arise within each department. My junior year, I discovered the field I wanted to pursue as a career: business/data analysis.</p>
			<p>It was a profession that seemed tailor-made for me; a synthesis of analysis, story-telling, problem-solving, creativity, and detail while ultimately helping others. Ever since, I've pursued analysis and business intelligence jobs while partaking in projects and activities to improve my skills in these areas.</p>
			<p>I am a very compelling communicator with a love for story-telling. I have a high level of discipline and integrity as a result of two wonderful parents and ten years in Tae Kwon Do, through which I earned a 2nd degree black belt</p>
			<p>Overall, I strive to serve and provide for others where ever I can. Whether that be solving a problem, meeting a goal, providing support, or just prompting a laugh, I love to help others while doing so with authenticity and integrity.</p>
